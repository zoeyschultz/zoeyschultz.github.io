## Introduction

Adam Ondra is widely considered the best climber in the world — but how does his performance actually compare in competitions and on real rock?

In this post, I use data from his IFSC results and outdoor ascents to explore his strengths, tradeoffs, and one surprising weakness that cost him at the Olympics.

## Chart 1: IFSC Rankings Over Time

Ondra’s peak performance in IFSC competitions came between 2013 and 2017, particularly in lead climbing where he was frequently ranked among the top 5. His rankings dip slightly around 2021, the Olympic year, before showing more variability in recent seasons.

```{r chart2, include=FALSE}

ascents <- read_csv("adam-ondra-best-climber/data/adam_all_ascents.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

ascents <- ascents |>
  filter(Grade %in% c("9a", "9a+", "9b", "9b+", "9c")) |>
  mutate(Date = dmy(Date), Year = year(Date))

sends_per_year <- ascents |>
  group_by(Year) |>
  summarise(HardSends = n(), .groups = "drop")

avg_ifsc_rank <- filtered |>
  group_by(Date) |>
  summarise(AvgRank = mean(Rank, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") |>
  rename(Year = Date)

combined <- inner_join(sends_per_year, avg_ifsc_rank, by = "Year")

chart2 <- ggplot(combined, aes(x = HardSends, y = AvgRank)) +
  geom_point(size = 4, color = "#377eb8") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40") +

## Chart 2: Outdoor Focus vs. IFSC Performance

This chart shows a clear tradeoff: in years when Ondra focused more on hard outdoor ascents...
