    "text": "Chart 1: IFSC Rankings Over Time\n\n\n\nAdam Ondra IFSC Rankings\n\n\nLet’s start with competition. Adam Ondra has competed in IFSC events since his teens, and for a while, he dominated. This chart shows his average IFSC rankings from 2010 to 2024 in two disciplines: lead and boulder.\nHis golden era came between 2013 and 2017. During those years, Ondra was a near-permanent fixture on the podium in lead climbing and consistently ranked in the top 5. His bouldering rankings were slightly more volatile — still strong, but not at the same level as his lead performances.\nThings start to shift around 2020–2021, coinciding with the Tokyo Olympics. That dip isn’t just a blip — it reflects a broader change in his climbing focus and possibly the rise of a younger generation of climbers who specialize in indoor formats.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Read the data quietly, drop unnamed column\nascents &lt;- read_csv(\"data/adam_all_ascents.csv\", \n                    show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  select(-starts_with(\"...\"))  # removes `...5` column to silence \"New names\"\n\n# Fix dmy() warning by explicitly handling parse failures\nascents &lt;- ascents |&gt;\n  filter(Grade %in% c(\"9a\", \"9a+\", \"9b\", \"9b+\", \"9c\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Date = suppressWarnings(dmy(Date)),  # suppress parsing warnings\n    Year = year(Date)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Date))  # drop any bad rows to avoid ggplot/NA warnings\n\n# Build datasets for chart\nsends_per_year &lt;- ascents |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(HardSends = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_ifsc_rank &lt;- filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(Date) |&gt;\n  summarise(AvgRank = mean(Rank, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  rename(Year = Date)\n\ncombined &lt;- inner_join(sends_per_year, avg_ifsc_rank, by = \"Year\")\n\n# Create chart, suppress geom_smooth formula print, suppress ggsave output\nchart2 &lt;- suppressMessages(\n  ggplot(combined, aes(x = HardSends, y = AvgRank)) +\n    geom_point(size = 4, color = \"#377eb8\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray40\") +\n    scale_y_reverse() +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Outdoor Focus vs. IFSC Performance\",\n      x = \"Number of 9a+ Outdoor Sends\",\n      y = \"Average IFSC Ranking (Lower is Better)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal()\n)\n\ninvisible(ggsave(\"images/chart2.png\", chart2, width = 8, height = 5))"

    "text": "Chart 2: Outdoor Focus vs. IFSC Performance\n\n\n\nOutdoor vs IFSC\n\n\nThis chart explores the tradeoff between Adam Ondra’s outdoor pursuits and his competitive performance. Specifically, it compares the number of 9a or harder routes he sent outdoors each year with his average IFSC ranking that same year.\nThere’s a clear pattern: when Ondra sends more hard outdoor routes, his IFSC ranking tends to suffer. This isn’t surprising — training for the World Cup circuit is incredibly specific, and time spent on real rock is time not spent in plastic bouldering gyms or lead training facilities.\nThe data suggests a strong inverse relationship between his outdoor activity and indoor performance. That may sound like a bad thing, but it also illustrates something important: Ondra wasn’t trying to win every competition. He prioritized a broader legacy — one that includes the world’s hardest outdoor climbs.\n\n\n\nCode\nclimbers &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  Climber = c(\"Adam Ondra\", \"Jakob Schubert\", \"Stefano Ghisolfi\", \"Tomoa Narasaki\", \"Sean Bailey\"),\n  HardestGrade = c(\"9c\", \"9b+\", \"9b+\", \"9a+\", \"9b\"),\n  Avg_IFSC_Rank = c(5.2, 6.1, 8.3, 7.5, 9.2),\n  Medals = c(38, 31, 19, 17, 10)\n)\n\ngrade_map &lt;- c(\"9a\" = 28, \"9a+\" = 29, \"9b\" = 30, \"9b+\" = 31, \"9c\" = 32)\nclimbers$GradeNumeric &lt;- grade_map[climbers$HardestGrade]\n\nchart3 &lt;- ggplot(climbers, aes(x = GradeNumeric, y = Avg_IFSC_Rank, size = Medals, label = Climber)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, color = \"#e41a1c\") +\n  geom_text(vjust = -1, size = 4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 28:32, labels = names(grade_map)) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(4, 12)) +\n  scale_y_reverse() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Elite Climbers: Outdoor Difficulty vs. IFSC Ranking\",\n    x = \"Hardest Outdoor Grade\",\n    y = \"Average IFSC Ranking (Lower is Better)\",\n    size = \"IFSC Medals\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\nggsave(\"images/chart3.png\", chart3, width = 8, height = 5)"

    "text": "Chart 3: How Ondra Stacks Up Against Other Elite Climbers\n\n\n\nElite Comparison\n\n\nSo how does Ondra compare to other top climbers?\nThis chart plots five elite climbers, comparing the hardest outdoor grade they’ve sent against their average IFSC competition rank. Bubble size represents the number of IFSC medals they’ve won.\nOndra is in a league of his own. He’s the only climber in this group to have sent a confirmed 9c — the hardest grade ever climbed — and still maintain a top-tier competition record. Others, like Jakob Schubert and Stefano Ghisolfi, have similar IFSC rankings and lots of medals, but their outdoor grades top out slightly lower.\nThen there’s Tomoa Narasaki, a bouldering specialist, and Sean Bailey, an American climber with impressive medals but less outdoor pedigree. They both excel in specific areas, but don’t show the same all-around dominance.\nThis reinforces the idea that Ondra isn’t just good — he’s versatile, and he’s stayed relevant across a much wider set of challenges than most climbers ever attempt."
