Adam Ondra has competed in IFSC events since his teens, and for a while, he dominated. This chart shows his average IFSC rankings from 2010 to 2024 in two disciplines: lead and boulder.\nHis golden era came between 2013 and 2017. During those years, Ondra was a near-permanent fixture on the podium in lead climbing and consistently ranked in the top 5. His bouldering rankings were slightly more volatile — still strong, but not at the same level as his lead performances.\nThings start to shift around 2020–2021, coinciding with the Tokyo Olympics. That dip isn’t just a blip — it reflects a broader change in his climbing focus and possibly the rise of a younger generation of climbers who specialize in indoor formats.\nCode\nascents &lt;- read_csv(\"data/adam_all_ascents.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  select(-starts_with(\"...\"))\n\nascents &lt;- ascents |&gt;\n  filter(Grade %in% c(\"9a\", \"9a+\", \"9b\", \"9b+\", \"9c\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Date = suppressWarnings(dmy(Date)),\n    Year = year(Date)\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Date))\n\nsends_per_year &lt;- ascents |&gt;\n  group_by(Year) |&gt;\n  summarise(HardSends = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\navg_ifsc_rank &lt;- filtered |&gt;\n  group_by(Date) |&gt;\n  summarise(AvgRank = mean(Rank, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  rename(Year = Date)\n\ncombined &lt;- inner_join(sends_per_year, avg_ifsc_rank, by = \"Year\")\n\nchart2 &lt;- suppressMessages(\n  ggplot(combined, aes(x = HardSends, y = AvgRank)) +\n    geom_point(size = 4, color = \"#377eb8\") +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"gray40\") +\n    scale_y_reverse() +\n    labs(\n      title = \"More Sends, Fewer Medals: Outdoor Focus Hurt Ondra's Rankings\",\n      subtitle = \"Years with more 9a+ outdoor climbs saw worse IFSC results.\",\n      x = \"Number of 9a+ Outdoor Sends\",\n      y = \"Average IFSC Ranking (Lower is Better)\"\n    ) +\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n    theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n      axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n      axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n      panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n      panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n    )\n)\n\nggsave(\"images/chart2.png\", chart2, width = 8, height = 5)\nSource: IFSC Rankings & Climbing History | By Zoey Schultz\nThis chart explores the tradeoff between Adam Ondra’s outdoor pursuits and his competitive performance. Specifically, it compares the number of 9a or harder routes he sent outdoors each year with his average IFSC ranking that same year.\nThere’s a clear pattern: when Ondra sends more hard outdoor routes, his IFSC ranking tends to suffer. This isn’t surprising — training for the World Cup circuit is incredibly specific, and time spent on real rock is time not spent in plastic bouldering gyms or lead training facilities.\nThe data suggests a strong inverse relationship between his outdoor activity and indoor performance. That may sound like a bad thing, but it also illustrates something important: Ondra wasn’t trying to win every competition. He prioritized a broader legacy — one that includes the world’s hardest outdoor climbs.\nCode\nclimbers &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  Climber = c(\"Adam Ondra\", \"Jakob Schubert\", \"Stefano Ghisolfi\", \"Tomoa Narasaki\", \"Sean Bailey\"),\n  HardestGrade = c(\"9c\", \"9b+\", \"9b+\", \"9a+\", \"9b\"),\n  Avg_IFSC_Rank = c(5.2, 6.1, 8.3, 7.5, 9.2),\n  Medals = c(38, 31, 19, 17, 10),\n  Highlight = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)\n)\n\ngrade_map &lt;- c(\"9a\" = 28, \"9a+\" = 29, \"9b\" = 30, \"9b+\" = 31, \"9c\" = 32, \"9c+\" = 33)\nclimbers$GradeNumeric &lt;- grade_map[climbers$HardestGrade]\n\nchart3 &lt;- ggplot(climbers, aes(x = GradeNumeric, y = Avg_IFSC_Rank, size = Medals, label = Climber)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Highlight), alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_text(vjust = 1.3, size = 4, fontface = ifelse(climbers$Climber == \"Adam Ondra\", \"bold\", \"plain\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"FALSE\" = \"#e41a1c\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = grade_map,\n    labels = names(grade_map),\n    limits = c(min(grade_map), max(grade_map))\n  ) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(4, 12)) +\n  scale_y_reverse(limits = c(10, 4.5), expand = expansion(mult = c(0.05, 0.3))) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"How Ondra Stacks Up Against Other Elite Climbers\",\n    subtitle = \"Among top climbers, he’s the only one leading in medals and outdoor difficulty.\",\n    x = \"Hardest Outdoor Grade\",\n    y = \"Average IFSC Ranking (Lower is Better)\",\n    size = \"IFSC Medals\",\n    color = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n\nggsave(\"images/chart3.png\", chart3, width = 9, height = 5)\nSource: IFSC Medals + Public Grade Records | By Zoey Schultz\nSo how does Ondra compare to other top climbers?\nThis chart plots five elite climbers, comparing the hardest outdoor grade they’ve sent against their average IFSC competition rank. Bubble size represents the number of IFSC medals they’ve won.\nOndra is in a league of his own. He’s the only climber in this group to have sent a confirmed 9c — the hardest grade ever climbed — and still maintain a top-tier competition record. Others, like Jakob Schubert and Stefano Ghisolfi, have similar IFSC rankings and lots of medals, but their outdoor grades top out slightly lower.\nThen there’s Tomoa Narasaki, a bouldering specialist, and Sean Bailey, an American climber with impressive medals but less outdoor pedigree. They both excel in specific areas, but don’t show the same all-around dominance.\nThis reinforces the idea that Ondra isn’t just good — he’s versatile, and he’s stayed relevant across a much wider set of challenges than most climbers ever attempt."

    "text": "One Format, Three Disciplines — and It Cost Ondra a Medal\nOndra, known primarily for his achievements in lead climbing and outdoor ascents, competed in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics under the combined format, which included speed climbing, bouldering, and lead. Final rankings were determined by multiplying each athlete’s placements across the three disciplines, meaning a lower placement in any one event could significantly affect the overall score.\nOndra placed 4th in speed, which was considered a strong result given that it is typically his weakest discipline. However, a 6th-place finish in bouldering, combined with 2nd in lead, resulted in a combined score that placed him 6th overall. While he performed well in both speed and lead, the bouldering round proved to be a limiting factor in his final ranking under the event’s scoring format.\nThis chart underscores the frustration many climbers felt with the 2020 format — a format that was split into separate events at Paris 2024."

This bubble chart reveals how younger athletes dominate the top ranks in speed, with the biggest bubbles clustering around ages 17 to 21. In contrast, top finishes in lead and bouldering are more spread out and tend to involve older competitors. The takeaway here is that speed rewards fast-twitch power and reaction time, traits that often peak earlier in life, while lead and bouldering may favor experience and endurance.\nCode\npodium &lt;- ifsc |&gt;\n  filter(rank %in% 1:3) |&gt;\n  group_by(discipline) |&gt;\n  summarise(min_age = min(age_at_competition), max_age = max(age_at_competition), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nchart2 &lt;- ggplot(podium, aes(x = min_age, xend = max_age, y = discipline)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = max_age, yend = discipline), color = \"#2b8cbe\", size = 2) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = min_age), color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = max_age), color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Speed Podium Finishers Are Younger\",\n    subtitle = \"1st–3rd place finishers in speed are younger than in other disciplines.\",\n    x = \"Age at Competition\",\n    y = \"Discipline\",\n    caption = \"Source: IFSC Finalist Results (2010–2024) | Visualization by Zoey Schultz\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16, margin = margin(b = 10)),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank()\n  )\n\nggsave(\"images/chart2.png\", chart2, width = 8, height = 5)\nchart2\nWhen it comes to the podium, speed climbers are not only younger, they’re consistently younger. This dumbbell chart compares the age ranges of 1st to 3rd place finishers across disciplines. Speed has the tightest spread and the youngest athletes at both ends.
